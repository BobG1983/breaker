## Insert-without-increment on first fire() — FIXED in Phase 1 cleanup

In effect `fire()` functions that accumulate state, the original bug inserted with
`accumulated: 0.0` on first call, missing the first trigger contribution. This was
confirmed in `ramping_damage.rs` Phase 1 original implementation.

**Current status**: FIXED. `ramping_damage::fire()` now inserts with
`accumulated: damage_per_trigger` on first call. `multi_call_accumulation_is_linear`
confirms: 4 calls at 0.5 yield 2.0 (not 1.5).

Watch for this pattern in other effect `fire()` functions that weren't reviewed.

## ccd_sweep_breaker fallback Aabb2D center semantics

`Aabb2D::new(center, half_extents)` stores `center` as-is in the `center` field.
`ray_intersect` uses `self.center` as world-space center. When constructing the
fallback expanded AABB in `ccd_sweep_breaker`, passing `breaker_pos` as center is
correct IF `breaker_pos` is already world-space. Confirmed correct — no bug.

## query_circle_filtered vs query_aabb_filtered in bolt_wall_collision

Old notes referred to `query_circle_filtered` — current code uses `query_aabb_filtered`.
The stale memory was corrected. Always verify which query function is actually used.
