## Known Bug Patterns (Fixed)
- **Double-tap consume uses 0.0 not NEG_INFINITY**: FIXED — `read_input_actions` uses `f64::NEG_INFINITY`.
- **check_valid_breaker_state missing Settling→Dashing transition**: FIXED.
- **check_valid_breaker_state Local tracks last entity only**: Documented; not re-flagged.

## Recurring Bug Categories
- **Stale screen resources**: RunSetupSelection, PauseMenuSelection, etc. persist between visits. Safe because `insert_resource` overwrites on re-entry.
- **Stale selection index**: All reset to 0 by spawn systems on OnEnter. Safe.
- **seed_upgrade_registry Local<bool>**: Persists for app lifetime. Correct — Loading only runs once.

## ECS Pitfalls Found
- `apply_bump_velocity` collects messages into Vec before querying — correct pattern for borrow conflicts.
- `ChipSelected` message has no consumer yet. Fire-and-forget, no ECS error.
- `spawn_chip_select` takes `Res<ChipRegistry>` (not Option) — guaranteed safe because Loading completes first.

## Phase 4 Wave 1 Confirmed Bugs (2026-03-19)
- `stack_u32` (apply_chip_effect.rs:204): `*current / per_stack` panics with integer division by zero when `per_stack=0`. No guard. Current RON files are safe (non-zero values), but future chips with `Piercing(0)` or `ChainHit(0)` would panic at stack-2 selection time.
