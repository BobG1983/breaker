//! Filters bolt-on-armor damage before the damage pipeline applies it.
//!
//! Reads `BoltImpactCell` messages for the current tick, looks up each hit's
//! target cell, and — for cells that are armored with a facing that matches
//! the impact normal — either drops the corresponding `DamageDealt<Cell>`
//! entry from `Messages<DamageDealt<Cell>>` (block) or decrements the bolt's
//! `PiercingRemaining` by `armor_value` (breakthrough). Non-armored hits,
//! and hits on armored cells from weak-point faces, pass through unchanged.
//!
//! Scheduling: `FixedUpdate`,
//! `.after(BoltSystems::CellCollision).before(DmgSystems::ApplyDamage)`,
//! `.run_if(in_state(NodeState::Playing))`. Ordering is the entire
//! correctness argument — the system mutates the `DamageDealt<Cell>` queue
//! after `bolt_cell_collision` has populated it and before
//! `apply_damage::<Cell>` reads from it.
